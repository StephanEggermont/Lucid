Use regular `XCTest` and Swift Package structure.

It is highly recommended to write unit tests for any new features in Lucid's framework. However, the codegeneration isn't unit tested, but rather proven to work with the [Sample project](Sample).

### Submit pull requests

Files should be exempt of trailing spaces and passed all unit tests.
