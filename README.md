# Lucid

Lucid is a Swift library for building robust data layers for applications.

- **Declarative**: Lucid makes it easy to declare complex data models and provides the tools to use it with plain Swift code.

- **Plug-and-play**: Use the stores which suit your data flow the best or write your own. Lucid gives you the infrastructure to seemlessly integrate the technologies you want to use.

- **Adaptability**: Built to fit most kinds of standard and non-standard server APIs, Lucid abstracts away server-side structural decisions by providing a resource oriented client-side API.
